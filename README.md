# Welcome to PWA with Siray!

This project is a companion to my blog post, "No, You CAN Design": https://siraysoiree.medium.com/no-you-can-design-785d0c8ad22e

Use this boilerplate to practice utilizing Grommet's Responsive Context (https://v2.grommet.io/responsivecontext) in order to create fully responsive, mobile-first UIs.

Use `npm start` to run the app (http://localhost:3000) and see your current screen size in the heading. Using "device toolbar" dev tools or manual window resizing, shrink and grow the view area to see the current screen size change.

Use `useContext` hooks in combination with Responsive Context in order to change render behavior based on the current screen size.

For more information on Grommet, check out their website (https://v2.grommet.io/) and read their docs (https://v2.grommet.io/docs)!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
